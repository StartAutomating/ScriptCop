ScriptCop is a tool to help make sure your scripts follow the rules.


ScriptCop performs static analysis on your PowerShell, and provides tools for automating testing with PowerShell.


When using ScriptCop analyzes your scripts, it it doesn't run your code, but it examines your code for a set of well-known problems.  You can write custom rules to flag bad scripting style, or you can use the dozens of rules built into ScriptCop.


You can also use ScriptCop to test your scripts.  By default, every command's example and demo becomes a test case for your module.  You can also write your own tests to make sure different parts are working.
